# Internal data structures

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a practical work of the Big Data course of the EMSE.

## Project participants:

- Caille Maxence - maxence.caille@etu.emse.fr
- Courtois Justin - justin.courtois@etu.emse.fr

## Objective:

The aim is to detect the words common to two files.
In this tutorial, we implement the calculation of this intersection of sets by means of a hash table.

## Use the project

Programs to execute : 
- [Main.py](https://github.com/maxant38/big_data_hash_table_intersection/blob/main/Main.py)
- launch the main function

## What's in the github repository:

The project is divided in four main components: the main program to launch the project, the main functions used and the front-end interface.

### Main Program 
File : [Main.py](https://github.com/maxant38/big_data_hash_table/blob/main/Main.py)

The Main Program is responsible for:

- Gather the different components of the project. This is the program to run if you want to use the project.
- Call the UI 

### Main function used
File : [TD.py](https://github.com/maxant38/big_data_hash_table_intersection/blob/main/TD.py)

- Define hash function
- Create hash table
- Count common words in two texts


### Front-end interface
File : [GUI.py](https://github.com/maxant38/big_data_hash_table_intersection/blob/main/GUI.py)

This component is responsible for:

- Creating a font-end interface for the user
- Let the user choose the files he wants to compare


## Built With:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Libraries used](https://github.com/maxant38/big_data_hash_table_intersection/tree/main/env/Lib/site-packages)
